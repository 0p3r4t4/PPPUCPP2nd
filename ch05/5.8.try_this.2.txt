Estimate the driving times. Also, estimate the corresponding flight times (using
ordinary commercial air travel). Then, try to verify your estimates by using 
appropiate sources, such as maps and timetables. We'd use online sources.

European citizen here so,
    1. My measures are in metric system
    2. My knowledge about U.S.A. Geography are very limited so I cheat a bit.

New York City to Denver

    So I know NY is in the East Coast, but I need to locate Denver on a map.
    I guess something between 2500 and 3000 km. So let's say 2750 km.

    Considering an average speed of 100 km/h, we can drive from NYC to Denver in
    about 27 hours and a half.

    I really don't know the average speed of commercial flights but let it be
    700 km/h. That gives us about 4 hours to fly from NYC to Denver.

    Results from Google Maps:
        Driving time: 25 hours (2866 km)
        Flight time: 4h 15 min

    Not so bad ...

London to Nice

    My distance guess is about 1000 km.

    Taking the same average speeds from the previous trip ...

    Driving time: 10 hours (versus 13 h 17 min from Google Maps)
    Fligh time: 1 and a half hours (versus 1 h 55 min from Google Maps)

    I obviously underestimate the distance between cities, being in fact 1392 km.
