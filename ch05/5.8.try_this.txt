Our hexagon was regular with 2cm sides. Did we get that answer right? Just do the
"back of the envelope" calculation. Take a piece of paper and scribble on it.
Don't feel that's beneath you. Many famous scientists have been greatly admired
for their ability to come up with an approximate answer using a pencil and the 
back of an envelope (or a napkin). This is an ability - a simple habit, really -
that can save us a lot of time and confusion.

Comments:

    The answer in the book comes up to 10.3923.
    
    Here come my guess:

        An easy method to draw a regular hexagon using a compass tool implies to set the
        compass to the length of the side and draw a circle with it. Hence, the radius
        of the circle and the side of the hexagon will be the same.

        We can consider the hexagon as inscribed to that circle whose area will be a
        good estimation to the area of the hexagon.

        Since we know, hopefully, that the area of a circle is π∙r² (PI*pow(radius, 2))
        we can calculate it with a radius of 2cm to obtain 12.56636cm².

        Our program result doesn't seem ridiculous. although our estimation is far from
        precise.
    
    Of course you can do more "back of the envelope" work and by dividing the
    hexagon on six equilateral triangles and using Pythagoras's theorem, is almost
    direct to formulate the area of the hexagon as (3*sqrt(3)*pow(s, 2))/2, with 's'
    the length of the hexagon's side.
    But I think the previous estimation is faster and fairly simple.
