## Statement

Write a grammar for bitwise logical expressions. A bitwise logical expression
is much like an arithmetic expression except that the operators are __!__
(not), __~__ (complement), __&__ (and), __|__ (or), and __^__ (exclusive or).
Each operator does its operation to each bit of its integer operands (see
25.5). __!__ and __~__ are prefix unary operators. A __^__ binds
tighter than a __|__ (just as __*__ binds tighter than __+__) so that __x|y\^z__
means __x|(y\^z)__ rather than __(x|y)\^z__. he __&__ operator binds tighter than
__^__ so that __x\^y&z__ means __x\^(y&z)__.

## Thoughts

The grammar has to be very similar to tha grammar we're managing for
arithmethic expressions.  There are two main differences:

-   There are three levels of binding compared to two in the arithmetic grammar.
-   Unary operators are introduced.

## Grammar

    Expression:
        PTerm
        Expression "|" PTerm
    PTerm:
        STerm
        PTerm "^" STerm
    STerm:
        Unary
        STerm "&" Unary
    Unary:
        Primary
        "!" Primary
        "~" Primary
    Primary:
        Number
        "(" Expression ")"
    Number:
        integer-number
