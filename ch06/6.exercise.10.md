## Statement

A permutation is an ordered subset of a set. For example, say you wanted to
pick a combination to a vault. There are 60 possible numbers, and you need
three different numbers for the combination. There are __P(60,3)__ permutations
for the combination, where P is defined by the formula

               a!
    P(a,b) = ------,
             (a-b)!

where __!__ is used as a suffix factorial operator. For example, __4!__ is
__4\*3\*2\*1__.

Combinations are similar to permutations, except that the order of the objects
doesn't matter. For example, if you were making a _"banana split"_ sundea and
wished to use three different flavors of ice cream out of five that you had,
you wouldn't care if you used a scoop of vanilla at the beginning or the end;
you would still have used vanilla. The formula for combination is

             P(a,b) 
    C(a,b) = ------.
               b!

Design a program that asks users for two numbers, asks them whether they want
to calculate permutations or combinations, and prints out the result. This will
have several parts. Do an analysis of the above requeriments. Write exactly what
the program will have to do. Then go into design phase. Write pseudo code for
the program, and break it into sub-components. This program should have error
checking. Make sure that all erroneous inputs will generate good error
messages.

## Analysis

Mathematical notation tends to use n and k rather than a and b for set and
subset cardinality, respectively. Permutations as defined by the statement are
a k-permutations of n, partial permutations or sequences without repetition
(see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation>). Combinations are
k-combinations of (a given set S of) n elements.  Both of them are __without
repetition__.

### About inputs

Let's consider finite sets and, thus, subsets. So n and k must be integers
and positive (natural numbers). And since we have no repetition, k must be
equal or less than n.

Does it makes sense for n or k to be 0? A bit of googling let me believe so,
and the definition of 0! as 1 simplifies the case. If we have an empty set,
in how many ways can do count nothing? Mathematicians answer to this is 1. The
formula P(0,0) supports this. If we have a non empty set, but we take empty
subsets P(n,0) is 1 again as there is only one way to take 0 elements from a
set. For me, it makes sense.

So input must fulfill these conditions:
 
    n is an integer so that n >= 0
    k is an integer so taht k >= 0
    n >= k

### Use cases

The user is asked to enter two natural numbers and one of two functions. Once
the function result is given, the user has the possibility to perform another
calculation or exit the program. The main use case could be seen as:

    Set cardinality?
    6
    Subset cardinality?
    3
    Function (c or C for combination, p or P for permutation)?
    p
    P(6,3) equals 120
    Do you want to perform another operation? (y/n)

We have restrictions on inputs, of course, that we must check and report errors
as we found them. An error on an user input will cause the program to report and
ask again for the same input.

Also, before restrictions are checked, the user could enter something that's
not an integer. The program must handle these wrong inputs. An example if this
is the input of a floating point number, that causes a correct read of an
integer number but ignores the decimal or the scientific notation part.

Also, we must check possible errors on permutation and combination calculation.
These errors are mainly related to integer type overflow. But this is more of
a design matter.

## Design

### Main loop pseudocode

The main body of the program will go on a loop until user asks for quitting:

    continue = true
    while input and continue 
        set_cardinality = get_natural()
        subset_cardinality = get_natural()
        check_input()
        operation = get_function()
        switch (operation)
            case 'p':
            case 'P':
                print result of permutation(set_cardinality, subset_cardinality)
            case 'c':
            case 'C':
                print result of combination(set_cardinality, subset_cardinality)
        continue = get_continue()

As set and subset cardinality inputs share the restriction to be positive but
also have a relationship restriction, we choose to apply the first on a common
function get_natural() and check the the later on another function
check_input(). It's a desgin decision; we could also create a function to get
each input or, doing so, create a third one to put the first restriction in its
own.

Each of get_ functions will print their messages and check the type correctness
of the input they received.

### Factorial

Formulas on the statement do heavy use of factorial operator. As implemented in
[6.exercise.03.cpp](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/ch06/6.exercise.03.cpp)
or as the classic example of recursion, factorial raises a problem as it grows
very rapidly. So fast, in fact, that with an int type we can't calculate
factorial beyond 12!. And what is worse, with the standard longer int type we
can not get beyond 20!. This implies that with the mentioned implementations we
can not even resolve the P(60,3) for the statement example.

While those implementations are discouraged by their limitations, there are, of
course, more [advanced
implementations](http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/FastFactorialFunctions.htm)
that allow to calculate factorial of large numbers, exactly or approximately
(as [Stirling's
approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation>)), 
with varying levels of range and effeciency. But such advanced implementations
require knowledge we _currently ignore_.

It's suspicious, though, that some of them rely on prime factorization and
hence [need the support of a prime sieve (a good implementation of
the sieve of Eratosthenes will
do)](http://www.luschny.de/math/factorial/conclusions.html), and we have
already implemented (perhaps not good enough) the sieve of Eratosthenes in
[exercise 13 from chapter
4](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/ch04/4.exercise.13.cpp). I
actually expect that, later on the book, these things that my mind revolves about
will be uncovered in a rather painful way.

So I ask myself; do we really need factorial to resolve this exercise?

### Permutation

### Combination

### Overflow detection

When we do arithmetic operations on integers, overflow (signed integers) or wrap
(unsigned integers) could happen. In some cases, there are no need to check if
it has happened but if it could happen we must actively guard against it.

As it turns, overflow (since we _don't know nothing about unsigned types_)
detection is not as easy as one might expect. Per example, previously to this
exercise, we have considered that if we add or multiply two positive integers
and the result is negative then the operation has overflowed. This is a flawed
consideration since C++ standard says that signed integer overflow results in
[undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior). So
testing for the result to be negative is not reliable since it's done in an
undefined behavior scenario.
