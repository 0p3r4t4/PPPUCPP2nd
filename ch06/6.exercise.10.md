## Statement

A permutation is an ordered subset of a set. For example, say you wanted to
pick a combination to a vault. There are 60 possible numbers, and you need
three different numbers for the combination. There are __P(60,3)__ permutations
for the combination, where P is defined by the formula

               a!
    P(a,b) = ------,
             (a-b)!

where __!__ is used as a suffix factorial operator. For example, __4!__ is
__4\*3\*2\*1__.

Combinations are similar to permutations, except that the order of the objects
doesn't matter. For example, if you were making a _"banana split"_ sundea and
wished to use three different flavors of ice cream out of five that you had,
you wouldn't care if you used a scoop of vanilla at the beginning or the end;
you would still have used vanilla. The formula for combination is

             P(a,b) 
    C(a,b) = ------.
               b!

Design a program that asks users for two numbers, asks them whether they want
to calculate permutations or combinations, and prints out the result. This will
have several parts. Do an analysis of the above requeriments. Write exactly what
the program will have to do. Then go into design phase. Write pseudo code for
the program, and break it into sub-components. This program should have error
checking. Make sure that all erroneous inputs will generate good error
messages.

## First thoughts

Mathematical notation tends to use n and k rather than a and b for set and
subset cardinality, respectively.
Permutations as defined by the statement are a k-permutations of n, partial
permutations or sequences without repetition
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation). Combinations are k-combinations of
(a given set S of) n elements.
Both of them are __without repetition__.

### About inputs

We are considering finite sets and, thus, subsets. So n and k must be integers
and positive (natural numbers). And since we have no repetition, k must be
equal or less than n.

Does it makes sense for n or k to be 0? A bit of googling let me believe so,
and the definition of 0! as 1 simplifies the case. If we have an empty set,
in how many ways can do count nothing? Mathematicians answer to this is 1. The
formula P(0,0) supports this. If we have a non empty set, but we take empty
subsets P(n,0) is 1 again as there is only one way to take 0 elements from a
set. For me, it makes sense.

So input must fulfill these conditions:
    
    n is an integer so that n >= 0
    k is an integer so taht k >= 0
    n >= k

### About formulas

Factorial could have overflow problems in integer type. In fact we will
overflow as soon as 13!. Should we use double instead?
Permutations calculation could be done without factorial, simply in a loop, to
make the overflow problem slightly better (taking care of 0!)
Empirical proof of this, please.
Factorial could be usefull in combinations calculation.
