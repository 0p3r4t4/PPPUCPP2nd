Hansel and Gretel

   Once upon a time a very poor woodcutter lived in a tiny cottage in the
   forest with his two children, Hansel and Gretel. His second wife often
   ill-treated the children and was forever nagging the woodcutter.
    
   "There is not enough food in the house for us all. There are too many mouths
   to feed! We must get rid of the two brats," she declared. And she kept on
   trying to persuade her husband to abandon his children in the forest.
