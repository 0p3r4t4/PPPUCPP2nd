   "Take them miles from home, so far that they can never find their way back!
   Maybe someone will find them and give them a home." The downcast woodcutter
   didn't know what to do. Hansel who, one evening, had overheard his parents'
   conversation, comforted Gretel.
 
   "Don't worry! If they do leave us in the forest, we'll find the way home,"
   he said. And slipping out of the house he filled his pockets with little
   white pebbles, then went back to bed.
     
   All night long, the woodcutter's wife harped on and on at her husband till,
   at dawn, he led Hansel and Gretel away into the forest. But as they went
   into the depths of the trees, Hansel dropped a little white pebble here and
   there on the mossy green ground. At a certain point, the two children found
   they really were alone: the woodcutter had plucked up enough courage to
   desert them, had mumbled an excuse and was gone.
