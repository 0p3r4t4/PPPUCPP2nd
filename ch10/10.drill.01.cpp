//  Start a program to work with points, discussed in ยง10.4. Begin by defining
//  the data type Point that has two coordinate members x and y.
//
// COMMMENTS
//
//  This is not exactly the Point from book, since it has public data
//  members and this has private data members. For such a trivial exercise it
//  would not matter, but I really prefer to hide data as a rule.
