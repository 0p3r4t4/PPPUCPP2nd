// Write three functions swap_v(int, int), swap_r(int&, int&), and
// swap_cr(const int&, const int&). Each should have the body:
//
//  { int temp; temp = a; a = b; b = temp; }
//
// where a and b are the names of the arguments.
// Try calling each swap like this ... (see main())
//
// Which functions and calls compiled, and why? After each swap that compiled,
// print the value of the arguments after the call to see if they were actually
// swapped. If you are surprised by a result, consult ยง8.6.
