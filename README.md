# Exercises (Try these and Drills) from Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd Edition)

(The canonical repository is hosted on <https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd>)

## Why

After more than a decade without doing any serious programming (some bash and
Python for system administration tasks do not count, I guess) I faced a
required massive modification of an old C program and got bitten again by the
coding snake.

I have two main points to struggle with:

-   A strong sense for a need to **return to the basics**.

-   A **personal debt with C++**, having already used it but just as a
    glorified C with classes (and from I've learned recently, doing so rather
    poorly and mistakenly).

I hope that **_Programming, Principles and Practice Using C++_** could cope
with those.

To be clear, I return to programming as a hobbyist. A full time job as a
sysadmin and two children don't let me be more ambitious. But that's fine to
me.

At first I only want to have a repository that I could synchronize and use
through my two personal systems and, perhaps, my mom's PC while visiting her.
Also, being very used to _subversion_, I saw an opportunity to play a bit with
_git_.  As a very shy person, I choose _GitLab(.com)_ (as opposed to
_GitHub(.com)_, although after the 20170131 database incident I setup a
mirror repository on <https://github.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd>) mainly, if not
only, by the unlimited private repositories.

As I proceeded through the book I've searched for references to compare my
exercises with. And I found it tremendously useful; find a better solution and
learn from it, catch those little details that I've disregarded, or, in the
rare ocassions when it happens, the triumphal sensation of thinking _"my
solution is better"_, are all enriching experiences.  And since I found
enrichment on others' job, it will be greedy not to share mine (you never know
if, or when, it will be useful to somebody else).

## About my exercises

I'm neither a seasoned programmer nor a newbie, so despite learning new things
through the study of the book, I also know a few things explained later or not
exposed at all (not a criticism since the book has its scope).

So, although I've tried to restrict myself to the contents of the book,
sometimes I investigate and go a little bit further, both right and wrong. I
feel that this behaviour is somehow enforced by the author in his perspective
about what programming is (or at least in how I understand him). In spite of
this, I think I don't deviate that much, so if somebody studying the book uses
this repository as a reference, there will be no problem to understand these
little oddities of mine.

As a point of fact:

-   I don't use `keep_window_open()` since in Linux it annoys me more that it
    helps me.

-   I tend not to use `error()` function provided by `std_lib_facilities.h`.
    Somehow I feel better throwing on my own.

-   I sometimes, as an user, don't buy the `a program is allowed to terminate
    after finding an error` assumption to the point that an user's input error
    causes no further opportunities.

> Well, the former is truth until exercise 10 from chapter 6, where I realize
> I'm pretending to be smarter than I actually am:

> -   using exception mechanisms wrong, being far from undestanding them
>     correctly, and going into well known pitfalls (as doing flow control with
>     them). 

> -   doing some bizarre coding to not terminate the program in case of certain
>     errors and failing to understand that **I'm learning** step by step and
>     far from being capable of doing bulletproof programs.

> In summary, I changed my mind and admit `error()` and `a program is
> allowed to terminate after finding an error` as the pedagogical tools they
> are. So expect a mix of solutions, some of them not too inspired.

Some exercises have a companion file with a _.input_ extension. Those are
input samples to quickly test programs with the help of command redirection.

## Notes

_In construction_

As an elderly, my memory is not what it used to be and I force myself to take
some notes from time to time:

-   [Use of compilers and
    tools](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/notes/compiler_and_tools.md).
    Don't expect a dense compilation here, as it's biased by my work
    environment.
-   [Use of Git and
    Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/notes/git_and_gitlab_howto.md).
    This could be included into "compilers and tools" but I prefer to have it
    separated.
-   [Literature](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/notes/literature.md).
    Mainly articles, references and guidelines that I read, voluntarily or by
    accident, and found interesting. 
-   [Tips and
    tricks](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/notes/tips_and_tricks.md).
    Aspects of programming and C++ that are not, or not yet, covered by the
    book but I want to remember once I faced or used them.

## My review of the book (so far)

_In construction_

Let me tell you that this book is hard. If you are committed to do almost every
drill and exercise, and have a family and a full time job (oh! and you're
watching American Gods, playing Mass Effect Andromeda, reading GÃ¶del, Escher,
Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid, and so on ...) this book will accompany you a
fair long time.

And because of its hardness I find it much more valuable. Programming
is a difficult task (and I mean DIFFICULT) and the author constantly remembers
you this fact, both explicitly and implicitly. Just as real as it is.

Implicitly because in his step-by-step approximation he shows you how you are
previously mistaken or not so successful in getting ahead with the tasks
proposed. He nicely do so by a writing style that is just a mental speech from
a real and seasoned programmer. If you are new to programming perhaps you
don't get how useful and what a timesaver this could be.

Implicitly because the exercises are fairly poor balanced, ranging from trivial
to those where you will cry out "I give up!", and exercise statements are
sometimes like a bad requirements elicitation and you can't simply do what is
stated but something more for your solution to correctly work. Just as real as
real programming job is.

As it sounds, it feels like a harsh review, but that would imply to
underestimate the author, something I wouldn't dare to do in regard to Bjarne
Stroustrup. Instead, I believe that all is an orchestrated master plan that, in
the end, makes it work like a terrific good introductory text to (real and
serious) programming.

## Platform, Compilers and Tools

I use mainly Ubuntu and derivative distros as programming platforms.

I use GCC version 5 as supplied for 16.04 release. If you want, or are in the
need, to use more modern versions than those supplied by the standard
repositories, you can install them from PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gcc-6 g++-6

I usually compile the exercises with a rather poor command line:

    g++ -std=c++1z -Wall -o <exercise> <exercise>.cpp

I also use the great [Termux](https://termux.com/) for Android, which provides
Clang instead of GCC, and serves well to program on the go.

Sometimes I perform static analysis on exercises with
[Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) and
[Clang-Tidy](http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/).  See [notes on compiler
and
tools](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/notes/compiler_and_tools.md)
for more details.

## License

I don't actually think that my source code in this repository deserves any
licensing.  It's far from useful in any real-world scenario other than
for educational purpouses (and perhaps not even that).

I don't care about what could be done with the source code, so I choose a [MIT
License](https://gitlab.com/0p3r4t4/PPPUCPP2nd/blob/master/LICENSE) for one
sole reason: the disclaimer of the warranty.

Said that, there are exceptions to my, almost complete, lack of interest in the
licensing terms. Such exceptions are:

-   `std_lib_facilities.h` file present in each chapter directory and other
    supporting code supplied by Bjarne Stroustrup in the [support site for
    the book](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming) are, of course,
    copyrighted by him. 

-   Problem statements heading almost every source file are excerpts from the
    book put there for my own convenience, and are, of course, copyrighted by
    Bjarne Stroustrup.

taking a look at these:

Of course, [Bjarne Stroustrup's Selected Exercise Solutions](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Solutions/exercise_solutions.html)
