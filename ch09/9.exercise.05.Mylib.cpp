//
// This exercise and the next few require you to design and implement a Book
// class, such as you can imagine as part of software for a library. Class Book
// should have members for the ISBN, title, author, and copyright date. Also
// store data on whether or not the book is checked out. Create functions for
// returning those data values. Create functions for checking a book in and
// out. Do simple validation of data entered into a Book; for example, accept
// ISBN only of the form n-n-n-x where n is an integer and x is a digit or a
// letter. Store an ISBN as a string.
