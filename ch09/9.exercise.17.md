## Statement

Give an example of a calculation where a _Rational_ gives a mathematically
better result than _Money_.

## About the example

Given that _Money_, after almost every operation, rounds the fractional part
from the result to only two ciphers to model cents, we can not
ask it for more. Whatever operation that results in more than two ciphers on
the fractional part will be better modelled by the _Rational_ class.

## Example

    ...
    Rational r{10};
    Money m{10,0,Currency::USD};

    cout << (r/80).float_point() << '\n';
    cout << m/80 << '\n';
    ...

## Result

    0.125
    USD0.13
