## Statement

Define an input operator (>>) that reads monetary amounts with currency
denominations, such as USD1.23 and DKK5.00, into a _Money_ variable. Also
define a corresponding output operator (>>).

## Solution

Those operators have been already implemented on 9.exercise.14.cpp and
9.exercise.15.cpp (although differently since the floating point constructor in
the latest simplifies the input operator a bit). It feels natural to me to have
them and indispensable to do some proper testing.

On exercise 15 the Money operators rely on Currency (<<) and (>>) operators.
