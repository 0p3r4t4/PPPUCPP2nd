## Statement

Give an example of a calculation where a _Rational_ gives a mathematical better
result than _double_.

## About the example

Testing exercixe 15 I've found out that 4.56 couldn't be exactly represented by
a double type variable. It's evident that you can't represent an infinite set
as real numbers with a finite set of binary numbers but somehow you would think
that such a simple number won't suffer from it. There are more examples to
"not so weird" numbers that can't be represented, as 0.1 or 2.675.

I will play with 4.56 and, correspondingly, 457/100 rational number. To see how
Rational performs with more precision, I simply multiply by 100 those numbers
to cancel the fractional part and print them as doubles setting cout precision
high.

## Example

    #include "std_lib_facilities.h"
    #include "9.exercise.13.Math.h"

    using namespace Math;

    int main()
    {
        Rational r{456,100};
        double d = 4.56;

        cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(17)
            << (r*100).float_point() << '\n';
        cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(17)
            << d*100 << '\n';

        return 0;
    }

## Result

    456.00000000000000000
    455.99999999999994316
