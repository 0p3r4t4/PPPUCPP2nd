// 9.exercise.11.cpp
//
//  Design and implement a set of useful helper functions for the Date class
//  with functions such as next_workday() (assume that any day that is not a
//  Saturday or a Sunday is a workday) and week_of_year() (assume that week 1
//  is the week with January 1 in it and that the first day of a week is a
//  Sunday).
//
// COMMMENTS
//
//  next_workday() is presented in ยง9.8 as next_weekday(). I'll replace it.
//  We have also declared but not implemented next_Sunday() and day_of_week().
//  Lets complete them.
//
//  Since the target of the exercise are helper functions, I won't touch
//  Date::add_day() or Date::add_month() that have poor implementations from
//  previous exercises.
